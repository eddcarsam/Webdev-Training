              Shaquille O’Neal (born March 6, 1972, Newark, New Jersey, U.S.)
              American basketball player, named in 1996 to the National
              Basketball Association (NBA) list of its 50 greatest players of
              all time. As a high-school senior in San Antonio, Texas, O’Neal
              attracted the attention of college recruiters when his team won
              the state championship. He attended Louisiana State University
              (LSU), where he quickly established himself as one of the best
              players in the nation. He was named the consensus College Player
              of the Year in 1991. O’Neal left school and entered the NBA
              draft in 1992 and was taken with the first pick by the Orlando
              Magic. In 2000, however, he finished his studies and earned a
              degree from LSU.
